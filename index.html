          My name is Eleanor Dick! I have been facinated by computer programming since
          before I could remember. When I was growing up my Grandfather would build computers 
          and program them as a hobby, I remember hours spent watching him in awe as he tinkered 
          away on his computer. Those hours sparked a love myself, I joined robotics teams all through elementary 
          and middle school and found my own way tinkering with computers and programming. 
          I got away from that love in high school and was brought back to it in college where I took the 
          University of Utah's Fullstack coding bootcamp and have already learned so much!
